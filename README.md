With increase in the what technology can do in the last few years, we cannot sit back and throw caution to the wind because of how technology has changed our lves in the following ways:
1.The introduction of Al and Machine Learning:
AI and ML has revoltionized industries by use of automation,providing predictive anaylysis.Examples of AI innovations include deep learning techniques, reinforcement learning, and neural network
Architectures like GAN(Generative Adverserial Networks)

    2. With the increase ofcyber secuity threats, cyber security innovations are important for data protection.Examples of technologies used are advancement in: threat intelligence,encryption techniques ,data analytics and endpoint security solutions.

    3. 5G Technology:
        I t offers higher speed,lower latency and higer connectivity as comared to previuos versions.Tis technology is used in areas such as remote surgery,Augmented Reality and Internet To  Things.

    4. Quantum computing:
        This solves complex problems that are  inteactive through complex computers.Advancements in  quantum algorinthms,qubit technologies,and error handling  sare giving way for  practical applications in cryptography
